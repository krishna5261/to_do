# To-Do List Web Application

This is a basic To-Do List web application that allows you to add tasks, write notes for tasks, separate tasks into completed and incompleted lists, delete tasks, and persist the tasks even after refreshing the page.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. You will see the To-Do List interface, where you can add, complete, delete, and take notes for tasks.

4. Use the following features:

- **Add Task:** Enter a task description in the input field and press the "Add Task" button. The task will be added to the incompleted tasks list.

- **Write Notes:** Click on a task to open a notes modal. Here you can write notes for the selected task and save them.
